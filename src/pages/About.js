                                    My Formal education is in the fields of Psychology and Media & Communication studies. I discovered programming by coincidence, and ever since I'm hooked.

                                <p>
                                    My First programming experience was with Java, since my journey began in an Android App Development course. After that course I joined <a href="https://she-codes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><mark>She Codes;</mark></a> organization as a student in their web course, and this is where I fell inlove with web development.

                                <p>
                                    I found my first entry level position at K Logic and simultaneously started to give back to the community by volunteering at <mark>She codes;</mark> as a Web Track Coordinator for a year and then as a Branch manager.

                                    I'm an enthusiastic coder, a <mark>creative</mark> and curious person who strives to always keep learning and growing both as a coder and as a human being.
                                    I'm a highly motivated self learner who is a hard working and a positive person. <mark>I like to tackle problems and appreciate debugging</mark>. 
                                    Among some of my interests and/or hobbies you can find things like art, patterns, collage, psychology, travelling, music, Twin Peaks, documentaries, classy films, Trashy films and coding.
