                                    My formal education is in the fields of Psychology and Media & Communication studies. I discovered programming by coincidence, and ever since, I'm hooked ü•Å.

                                    My first programming experience was with Java, since my journey began in an Android App Development course. After that course, I joined <mark>She Codes;</mark> Organization as a student in their web course, and this is where I fell in love with web development.

                                    I found my first entry-level position at <a href='https://www.k.co.il/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><mark>K Logic</mark></a> and simultaneously started to give back to the community by volunteering at <mark>She Codes;</mark> as a Web Track Coordinator for a year and then as the Amazon Branch manager for three more years. I also wrote their React course curriculum and taught it to hundreds of students.
